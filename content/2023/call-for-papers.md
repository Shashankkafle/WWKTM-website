      <p> All submissions are reviewed and voted for by the conference organizers. Each talk is rated on a scale
        from 1 to 5, taking into account the following criteria: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>relevance of the topic to the Web community</li>
        <li> coherence and clarity of the proposal</li>
        <li> novelty/originality of the topic </li>

      <h4> Three </h4>
      <p> The top submissions are then de-anonymized so we can take speaker details into account. We expect a lot
        more excellent submissions than we have speaking slots. This process helps us select the best proposals,
        and hack our own unavoidable biases. </p>

  <h2> <span class="break"> Financial Matters </span> Travel Support </h2>
  <p>
  As a community-run initiative, our budget for the conference is limited. To help offset the costs of travel, we typically request that speakers arrange their own flights through their respective organizations. However, <strong>we do offer limited travel support to a select few speakers each year, in the form of a $500 allowance.</strong> If you are interested in potentially receiving travel support, please make a note of it in the CFP form.
