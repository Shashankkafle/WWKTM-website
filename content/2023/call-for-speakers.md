      <h4> Two </h4>
      <p> All submissions are reviewed and voted for by the conference organizers. Each talk is rated on a scale
        from 1 to 5, taking into account the following criteria: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>relevance of the topic to the Web community</li>
        <li> coherence and clarity of the proposal</li>
        <li> novelty/originality of the topic </li>

      <h4> Three </h4>
      <p> The top submissions are then de-anonymized so we can take speaker details into account. We expect a lot
        more excellent submissions than we have speaking slots. This process helps us select the best proposals,
        and hack our own unavoidable biases. </p>

  <h2> <span class="break"> Financial Matters </span> Travel Support </h2>
  <p>
    Since we are a community led initiative, we have a limited budget for the conference. We generally request our speakers to arrange flight tickets via the organisations they are involved with. If you are a speaker who would like support with travel, please choose to mention that in the CFP form. In the past, we’ve supported one or two speakers (each year) by providing $500 as travel support.
